# BeatSaber13.2To12.2
Beat Saber maps created after Mediocre Mapper mk4 release will not run on beat saber version 12.2. This fixes that issue.

TUTORIAL:

1) Download the program
2) Extract it somewhere easy to remember (Desktop/Documents/Downloads/etc... Whichever one you like the most I guess)
3) ***MAKE A COPY OF YOUR BEATSABER CUSTOM SONGS FOLDER*** If all your songs break because some random thing went wrong, it's not my fault if you don't back up your songs.
4) You'll probably need Java as this is a .jar executable file. If, somehow, you don't already have Java. It can be found here: https://www.java.com/en/download/

Time for the real tutorial:
5) Go to the windows search bar in the bottom left of the desktop, and type: cmd
6) Hit enter and a terminal window should open. Type java -jar $PATH_NAME$ (where $PATH_NAME$ represents the absolute path to the jar executable inside the folder you just downloaded.
7) For example, if you downloaded to your desktop, it might look something like this: java -jar C:\Users\Chris\Desktop\BeatSaber13.2To12.2\BeatSaberMapCleanse\out\artifacts\BeatSaberMapCleanse_jar\BeatSaberMapCleanse.jar
8) Hit enter and in your terminal window, text should show up instructing you on how to proceed.
9) It will tell you to write the absolute path of your custom songs folder. This will look something like: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\CustomSongs
10) Once you do this and hit enter, it will force all the songs made on the new mediocre mapper to be playable on version 12.2 of beatsaber.


NOTES:
I'm not sure if altering the files still allows you to upload scores on these maps to scoresaber. THIS IS WHY I ADVISE YOU MAKE A COPY OF YOUR BEAT SABER CUSTOM SONGS FOLDER
